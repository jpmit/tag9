Space Battle
------------
Entry in 'The Arbitrary Game Jam 9' (48 hour jam) by 'jpmit'.

This is an HTML5 game, written in javascript, using the 'canvas'
element.  It should work in virtually all modern browsers.  It can be
played as a local two player game (i.e. with both players using the
same keyboard) or single player vs AI.

The theme I chose to incorporate is 'decay'; each player's health
decays in time.  The idea is that this could lead to new strategies
for winning, such as running from your opponent.

The game is also available in the Google chrome webstore, see:
